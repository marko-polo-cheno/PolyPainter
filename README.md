# PolyPainter
Turn any image into a colour-by-numbers kit!
Made by Mark Chen.

What is the issue with most colour by number kits out there?
- Sold out.
- Not enough selection for your specific home decor.
- Not enough colours.
- Not intricate enough.
- No expected final product given.

TLDR, PolyPainter is a solution that handles all those issues.
This app takes in any portrait, scenery, painting, drawing, etc. and makes it a colour by number kit!
However, the canvas size, number of colours, and complexity level is customizable.

Stay tuned for updates.
